# Rext.jsÂ ðŸ¦– = React + Next.js
My attempt of recreateing React and Next.js (Server Side Rendering) to better understand how they both work under the hood

Based on [Makeshift Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RzhNYhjVAw&ab_channel=TejasKumar) and [Deconstructing React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2mMOiCSj5c&ab_channel=CodingTech).
